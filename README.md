# Lab 5 - Starter

1. I would not use a unit test to test the whole message feature of a messaging application as it a more complex feature with multiple components, including a smaller component that takes and processes user input, and a component that handles the networking of sending the message.

2. I would use a unit test to test the max message length feature of a messaging application, as the feature is small and simple, without dependence on other features, making it the perfect candidate for a unit test.
